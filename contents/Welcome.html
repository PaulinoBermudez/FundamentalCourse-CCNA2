						<p>
							Welcome to the CCNA Routing and Switching Essentials couser. The goal of this course is to introudce you to fundamental
							networking concepts and technologies. These online course materials will assist you in developing the skills necessary to plan 
							and implement small networks supporting a range of applications. The specific skills covered in each chapter are described at 
							the start of each chapter.<br>
							You can your small phone, tablet, laptop or desktop to access the course, participate in discussions with your instructor, view your grades,
							read or review text, and practice using interactive media. However, some media are complex and must be viewed on a PC, as well as Packet Tracer activities, 
							quizzez and exams.
                        </p>

						<h2>A Global Community</h2>
						
						<p>
							When you participe in the Networking Academy, you are joining a global community linked by common goals and technologies. Schools, collages, universities and 
							other entutues in over 160 countries participate in the program. A visualization of the global Networking Academy community  is available at https://www.netacad.com/
							<br>
							Look for Cisco Networking Academy official site on Facebook &COPY; and Linkedln&copy;.  The Facebook site is where you can meet and engage with other Networking Academy 
							students from around the world. The Cisco Networking Academy Linkedln site connects you with job posting, and you can  see how other are effectively communicating their skills. 
						</p>

						<h2>More just information</h2>
					
					<section>
						<p>
							The netAcad learning environment is an important part of the overall course experience for students and instructors in the Networking Academy. These online course materials include course text and related interactive media, 
							Packet Tracer simulation activities, real equipments labs, remote access labs, and many different types of quizzes. All of these materials provide important feedback to help you assess your progress throughout the course. <br>
							The material in this course encompasses a broad range of technologies that facilitate how people work, live, play and learn by communicating with voice, video and other data. Networking and the Internet addect people differently 
							in different parts of the world.Althoung we have worked with instructors from around the world to create these materials, it's important that you work with your instructor and fellow  students to make the material in this course applicable 
							to your local environment. 
						</p>

						<h2>How we teach</h2>
					
					<section>
						<p>
							E-doing is a design philosophy that appllies the principle that people learn best by doing. The curricum includes embedded, higly interactive e-doing activities to help simulate learning, increase knowledge retention and make the whole learning 
							experience richer - and that makes understanding the content much easier.

						<h2>Practice leads to mastery</h2>
					
					<section>
						<p>
							In a typical lesson, after learning about a topic for the first time, you will check your understanding with some interactive media items. If there are new commands to learn, you will ractice them with the Syntax Checker before using the commands 
							to configure or troubleshoot a network in Packet Tracer, the Networking Academy network simulation tool. Next, you will do practice activities on the real equipment in your in your classroom or accessed remotely over the Internet. <br>
							Packet Tracer can also provide additional practice any time by creating your own activities or many want to competitively test your skills with classmates in multi-user games. Packet Tracer skills assessment  and skills integration labs give you rich 
							feedback on the skills you are able to demonstrate and are grat practice for chapter, checkpoint and final exams.
						</p>

						<h2>Mind wide open</h2>
					
					<section>
						An important goal in education is to enrich you, the student, by expanding what you know and can do. It's important to realize, however, that the instructional materials and the instructor can only facilitate the process. You must make the commitment yourself to 
						learn new skills. The following pages share a few suggestions to help you learn and prepare for transitioning your new skills to the workplace.
					</section>
					
						<h2>Engineering Journals</h2>
					
					<section>
						<p>
							Professionals in the networking field often keep Engineering Journals in which they write down the things they observe and learn such as how to use protocols and commands. Keeping an Engineering Jorunal creates a reference you can use at wirk in your ICT job. 
							Writing is one way to reinforce your learning - along with reading, seeing and practicing. <br>
							A sample entry for implementing a technology could include the necessary software commands, the purpose od the commands, command variable and a topology diagram indicating the context for using the commands to configure the technology.
						</p>
					</section>
					
						<h2>Explore the World of Networking</h2>
					
					<section>
						<p>
							Packet Tracer is a networking tool for learning that support a wide range of physical and logical simulations. It also provides visualization tools to help you understand the internal workings of a network. <br>
							The pre-built Packet Tracer activities consist of network simulations, games, activities and challenges that provide a broad range of learning experiences. These tools will help you develop an understanding of how data flows in a network.
						</p>
					</section>
					
						<h2>Create your own worlds</h2>
					
					<section>
						<p>
							You can also use Packet Tracer to create your own experiments and networkings scenarios. We hope that, over time, you consider using Packet Tracer - not only for experiencing the pre-built activities, but also to become an author, explorer, and experimenter. <br>
							The online course materials have embedded Packet Tracer activities that will launch on computers running Windows&reg; Operating Systems, if Packet Tracer is installed. This integrations will also  work on other operating system using Windows emulation. <br>

						<h2>How Packet Tracer Helps Master Concepts.</h2>
					
					<section>
						<p>
							<h4>Educational Games</h4>
							Packet Tracer Multi-User games enable youe or team to compete with other students to see who can accurately complete a series of networking tasks the fastest. It's an excellent way to practice the skills you are learning in Packet Tracer activities and hands-on labs.
							Cisco Aspire is a single-player, standalone strategic simulation game. Players test their networking skills by completing contracts in a virtual city. The Networking Academy Edition is specifically designed to help you prepare for the CCENT certification exam. It also 
							incorporates business and communication skills ICT employers seek in job candicates. <br>
							<h4>Performance-Based Assessment</h4>
							The Networking Academy performance-based assessment have you do Packet Tracer activities like you have been doing all aling, only now integrated with an online assessment engine that will automatically score your results and provide you with immediate feedback. This feedback 
							helps ypu to more accurately identify the knowledge and skills you have mastered and where you need more practice. There are also questions on chapter quizzes and exams that use Packet Tracer activities to give you additional feedback on your progress.

					<h2>Course Overview</h2>
					<section>
						<p>
							As the course title states, the focus of this course is on learning the architecture, components  and operations of routers and switches in a small network. In this course, youwill learn how to configure a router and a switch for basic functionality. You will do the following.
							<ul>
								<li>Configure and verify static routing and default routing</li>
								<li>Configure and troubleshoot basic operations of a small switched network</li>
								<li>Configure and troubleshoot basic operations of routers in a small routed network</li>
								<li>Configure and troubleshoot VLANs and inter-VLAN routing</li>
								<li>Configure,monitor and troublshoot ACLs for IPv4</li>
								<li>Configure and verify DHCPv4 and DHCPv6</li>
								<li>Configure and verify NAT for IPv4</li>
								<li>Configure and monitor networks using device discovery, management and maintenance tools</li>
							</ul>
